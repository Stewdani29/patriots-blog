        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>
            After a disastrous 2-8 start, it's finally the bye week in New England. The Patriots organization hoped to
            be sitting in a better spot after 10 games, but this is the situation they find themselves in.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'> With there not being a game this weekend, I thought it would be a good time to fill out another Patriots
            stock report.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'> Keep in mind, that I'm basing this off of a recent play. For that reason, a guy like Christian Gonzalez,
            whose stock is through the roof, won't be listed, simply because he's injured and hasn't played.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>  With all that in mind, here's my Patriots stock report.</p>

        <h2 style='font-weight: bold;line-height: 1; font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;font-size: 27px; text-align:center;color: #333;'> Up</h2>
    </div>
    <div style='width:66%; margin:auto;'>
    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;font-weight: bold;'>Mike Onwenu</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>Have the Patriots found themselves a long-term right tackle? It appears they may have. In 4 games at right tackle, Mike Onwenu has given up 4 total pressures. He's also been a dominant force in the run game. It's no coincidence that the Patriots have begun to run the ball better as of late.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>Onwenu is a free agent after this season, and at this point, he's a must-keep. The former Michigan product has provided stability to a position that has desperately needed it.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;font-weight: bold;'>Jahlani Tavai</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>You have to love the type of player Jahlani Tavai has developed into. Tavai has 61 combined tackles, 4 pass deflections, 1 forced fumble, 2 tackles for loss, and 3 quarterback hits this year.</p>

<div style='width:66%; margin:auto;'>
    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>Maybe none of that pops out to you, but Tavai has been a consistent force in just about every aspect of defense. He can run defend, he pass rushes well in his limited pass-rushing reps, and maybe most surprising is how well he's been in pass coverage.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>Tavai had a breakout 2022 season and I'd argue he's gotten even better in 2023. His growth as a player has been remarkable to watch.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;font-weight: bold;'>Christian Barmore</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>We've begun to see Christian Barmore hit a new gear. Barmore had a fine start to the year, but he's reached new heights in recent weeks.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>In total, this season, Barmore has 26 total pressures per PFF. He's also batted down a few passes at the line of scrimmage.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>Barmore's pass rushing is more refined than his run defending, but he's not bad in that area either.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>If he can continue on this path, Barmore is going to become one of the more dominant interior pass rushers in the NFL. He's got the talent and it's really starting to flash this season. Keep in mind, Barmore is only 24 years old. He should be around for a while.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;font-weight: bold;'>Jabrill Peppers</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>It's worth shouting out Jabrill Peppers for a couple of reasons. He's a great run-defending safety and he's formidable in pass coverage too.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>Peppers is as durable as it gets and he's also shining as a leader. Peppers has come into his own in the past two years in New England.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333; font-weight: bold;'>Demario Douglas</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>The numbers aren't going to "wow" you, but Demario Douglas is a bright spot on this team. His 30 catches for 361 yards are more reflective of the poor offense around him than his skill level.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>Douglas has a ton of talent and it's apparent when watching him play. Pop is one of few players on the Patriots that can beat man coverage and he's so shifty after the catch.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>Douglas will be a fun player to watch the rest of the year.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;font-weight: bold;'>Mac Jones</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>The hope was that Mac Jones would have a bounce-back season after a bad 2022, but that hasn't happened. In fact, you could argue Jones has actually gotten worse.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>The stat that pops out to me most is his 19 turnover-worthy plays according to PFF. That leads the entire NFL. Jones looks like he's completely lost confidence.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>It's not just a quarterback problem in New England, the situation isn't great, but Jones bears responsibility for his mechanics turning to crap and his inability to take care of the football.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>It's been really unfortunate to see Jones continue to regress.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;font-weight: bold;'>Tyquan Thornton, JuJu Smith-Schuster, and DeVante Parker</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>I'm grouping these three wideouts together because it's been a disappointing year for them all.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>Starting with Tyquan Thornton who just hasn't been able to build any momentum in New England. He's not even played this season outside of a handful of snaps.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>As for JuJu Smith-Schuster and DeVante Parker, they just haven't been able to live up to the billing of productive veteran wideouts. Both look incredibly limited when on the field.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333; font-weight: bold;'>J.C. Jackson</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>J.C. Jackson is trending down both on and off the field. Jackson was benched to start the game against the Commanders a couple of weeks ago and then told to stay home during the Patriots trip to Germany to play the Colts.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>This came after Jackson was also told to stay home and was cut from the Chargers earlier this year. That's not great.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>On top of all this, Jackson hasn't been a good corner to begin with. His fall off from two seasons ago has been dramatic.</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Montserrat", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.6rem;line-height: .4;color: #333; font-weight: bold;'>Bonus</p>
    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333; font-weight: bold;'>Cole Strange</p>

    <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;color: #333;'>The former first-round pick has struggled with injuries this season and he's also struggled when on the field too. In only 6 games, Strange has allowed 18 total pressures per PFF. It's not been good enough.</p>
